# Student Management System

## Overview

The **Student Management System** is a console application built in C# that demonstrates the use of various data structures including dictionaries and sets. The application allows for the management of student information, course codes, and class enrollment operations.

## Features

- **Dictionary Operations**: Manage student records using a dictionary that maps student IDs to names.
- **HashSet Operations**: Store and manage unique course codes.
- **Set Operations**: Perform mathematical set operations on students enrolled in Math and Science classes, including intersection, union, and difference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK installed on your machine.
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the solution or project file in your preferred IDE.
3. Build the project to restore dependencies.

### Running the Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application using the command:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

4. Follow the prompts in the console to explore the features.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following main sections:

- **Main Method**: The entry point of the application, orchestrating the demonstration of various tasks.
- **DemonstrateDictionary Method**: Shows how to create and manipulate a dictionary for student records.
- **DemonstrateHashSet Method**: Demonstrates the usage of a HashSet for managing unique course codes.
- **DemonstrateSetOperations Method**: Performs various set operations on student enrollment in Math and Science classes.
- **DisplaySet Method**: A helper method to display the contents of a HashSet.

## Example Outputs

The application will display outputs related to student records, unique course codes, and results of set operations, including:

- Student directories with IDs and names.
- Lists of unique course codes.
- Students enrolled in both Math and Science classes.
- Enrollment statistics and analysis.
