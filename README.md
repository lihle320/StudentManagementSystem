Student Management System
Overview
The Student Management System is a console application built in C# that demonstrates the use of various data structures including dictionaries and sets. The application allows for the management of student information, course codes, and class enrollment operations.

Features
Dictionary Operations: Manage student records using a dictionary that maps student IDs to names.
HashSet Operations: Store and manage unique course codes.
Set Operations: Perform mathematical set operations on students enrolled in Math and Science classes, including intersection, union, and difference.
